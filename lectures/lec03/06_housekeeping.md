## Housekeeping: Don't ask to ask, just ask

When someone asks...

> Any [thing] experts around?

What they really mean is...

> Any [thing] experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually related to [thing] or if someone who doesn't know anything about [thing] could actually answer my question?

In other words...

> I have a question about [thing] but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it

## Housekeeping: Don't ask to ask, just ask

Instead, just ask...

> How do I do [problem] with [thing]? \
>
> - I want [this kind of result]... \
> - I tried [this other thing]... \
> - [something] happened...

## Housekeeping: Using Piazza

How to ask questions and get better/faster answers:

- Make your question public unless it's sensitive.
- Search for duplicates before posting.
- Search on the internet first.\*
- When asking a question, include as much information as you can.
  - Show us code (if it isn't sensitive) or shell output.
  - Describe what you tried and why it doesn't work.
  - If a potential answerer has to ask you for basic information about your question, they'll be inclined not to answer at all.

\* but please don't commit an academic offence...
