## Acknowledgements

Thanks to...

- [Karen Reid](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/) for teaching me CSC209+369.
- Andi Bergen for providing many of these slides ($\beta$).

## CSC209: What's it about?

- Interacting with a UNIX-like OS using the shell
- Systems programming with a UNIX focus: file system, process
  management, system calls, inter-process communication.
- C; but other systems languages include C++, Go and Rust.
- Programming tools for efficient coding:
  - Debugging tools: `gdb`, `valgrind`, `strace`, `ltrace`
  - Build automation: `make`
  - Version control: `git`

## CSC209: Assignment Details

- Docs: writing a `man` page for a new command (part 1) and
  revising/improving (part 2).
- Coding: submissions might be evaluated for correctness,
  memory/compute efficiency, and _elegance_.
- Submission on GitLab:
  ```sh
  git clone https://mcsscm.utm.utoronto.ca:9999/git
      /209/23s/repo_[UTORID].git
  ```
- Autotested; make sure files are correct and that everything compiles.
  - Crashes or compile errors will result in a 0.
- All individual! We have plagiarism detection tools...
- 8 grace tokens, max 4 on any assignment.
