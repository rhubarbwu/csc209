# File Input/Output (I/O)

## File I/O: File Descriptors

![Example of FDs pointing to inodes.](figures/file-descriptor.jpg){width=80%}

A file descriptor (FD) is a number (non-negative integer) that uniquely identifies an open file in a computer's operating system. It describes a data resource, and how that resource may be accessed.

## File I/O: Streams, File Descriptors & Pointers

Streams are files to which data is written or from which data is read. They're accessed through file pointers (`FILE *` from `<stdio.h>`) that wrap around FDs. The following default streams (FDs) are provided by `<stdio.h>`.

- `stdin` (0): default input; typically from user keyboard or pipes.
- `stdout` (1): default output; usually to terminal screen or pipes.
- `stderr` (2): default error; also to terminal screen.
- Use `>` to _redirect_ `stdout`, and `2>` to redirect `stderr`
  - `>` overwrites the output file, `>>` appends to it.

## File I/O: Opening a File with Modes

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char * mode);
```

A file `filename` is opened with `fopen()` in a `mode` `{r|w|a}{|+}` to perform the following operations. Returns a file pointer that wraps the FD. The pointer is `NULL` if we fail to open the file (often because the file doesn't exist or your process doesn't have permission).

| action\\mode  | `r`  | `w`    | `a`    | `r+` | `w+`     | `a+`   |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| read          | yes  | no     | no     | yes  | yes      | yes    |
| write         | no   | yes    | no     | yes  | yes      | yes    |
| append        | no   | no     | yes    | no   | no       | no     |
| file exists   | ok   | ok     | ok     | ok   | truncate | append |
| doesn't exist | fail | create | create | fail | ok       | create |

## File I/O: Closing a File: `fclose()`

```c
int fclose(FILE *stream);
```

- `stream`: a `FILE *` opened by `fopen()`/`freopen()`.
- returns: `0` if closed properly, `EOF` otherwise.

You should always close files (as soon as possible) when you're done with them.

```c
if ((fp = fopen("doesnt_exist.txt", "a")) == NULL) {
    fclose(fp);
    return 1;
}
```

## File I/O: Reading & Writing

### Reading

1. `getchar()`: read a character from `stdin`.
2. `fgetc()`: read a single character from the file.
3. `fgets()`: read strings from files.
4. `fscanf()`: formatted input from a file.
5. `fread()`: block of raw bytes from files; useful for binary files.

Examples: `e1.c`, `e2.c`.

### Writing

You can use `putchar()` to write a character to `stdout`.

```c
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size,
    size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
```

Alternatively, use `fwrite()` to write `nmemb` elements (each `size` large) from `*ptr` to `stream`.
